Hi all,

My first zone will be a massive newbie area called Ferrycourse Fen. I've 
mapped it out and am filling in descriptions now. I've sketched out mobs
and objects and will get those in there soon enough.

For a quick peek, go northwest from Temple Square in Midgaard. This leads
you to the first room in the zone, outside the gates of the future
starting city of Fasth. I'd love some feedback on the descriptions so
far. I'll let y'all know when mobs and objs appear.
